### SIGN LANGUAGE RECOGNITION TO SPEECH TRANSLATION

#### Sign Language:
Sign Language is a form of communication used by several people all over the world
who has the disability of speaking. Sign language is also used by many people where
the language of communication is different from the recipient. 

I wanted to develop a simple but effective system which can be trained and used
immediately. I have made use of Open CV techniques and used Python as the programming
language for the development of the system.

I would be updating this repository very soon, with clear instructions to replicate 
the code. 

This repository contains a simple implementation of sign language recognition to 
speech translation using Python and OpenCV.


This repository is yet to be populated !!!!!!!
